# Discord.JS #1 - Setup client
In this tutorial we will cover the basics. How do you properly set up your client? And how do you make sure you can see commands? 

## 📝・The beginning
Before you start check if you have nodejs. If you don't have this, you can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

We use [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for this tutorial.

When you have opened the project you can open a terminal with ` ctrl+shift+` `

Run the following commands in it
> Install all packages
```
npm install
```
> Create an .env file
```D
cp .env.example .env
```
Fill in all necessary details with your .env file.
Make sure you have already created a bot in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.dev/)
